# Mind-Motion
Mind & Motion is a personal blog created by Jillian Fernandes — a computer science student with an interest in fitness, food, photography, and creativity.
This project showcases my experiences and hobbies while also serving as a front-end web development project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**About the Project**

This website was designed and coded from scratch to explore front-end development concepts and responsive design.
Each page highlights a different part of my interests — from workouts and travel to food, art, and daily life.
